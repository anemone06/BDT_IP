The ALJ shortly thereafter denied M-Class's expedition motion and a few days later MSHA terminated the Order. Approximately two and one-half months after terminating the Order, the Secretary moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and mootness because the Order had been terminated. The ALJ denied the motion, concluding his jurisdiction continued and the case was not moot.

That is, it makes clear that if, contrary to expectations, Markham were entitled to the copyright in the game, he would, at Link's request, assign it over. See Marvel Characters, 726 F.3d at 143 (suggesting that a freelancer's assignments could be “redundancies insisted upon by [the hiring party] to protect its rights” rather than an indication that the  *86 hiring party “did not already own the rights”). This reading is supported by the tentative, open-ended language (“to which he may be entitled,” “any such copyright”) (emphasis added), which appears to be an attempt to cover all conceivable bases without acknowledging that any rights actually belong to Markham. Regardless, this language is not the required “express contractual reservation of the copyright in the artist.” Lin-Brook, 352 F.2d at 300. The district court thus supportably found that the assignment agreement did not overcome the presumption that the game was a work for hire made for Klamer.
