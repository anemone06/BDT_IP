Your task is to analyze web pages and determine if they contain information that helps answer a question, based on the reasoning steps so far.\n\n**Evaluation Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Direct Answer:** Does any web page directly answer the **Current Search Query**? (e.g., \"Yes, Afghanistan grants citizenship by birth\" or \"No, it does not.\")\n\n2.  **Strongly Relevant Clue:** If there is no direct answer, does any web page provide information that **logically implies** an answer or **significantly narrows down the possibilities**? This includes:\n    *   Information about the underlying principles (e.g., \"The law is based on jus sanguinis/right of blood\").\n    *   Descriptions of necessary conditions that contradict the query (e.g., \"Citizenship requires at least one parent to be a citizen\").\n    *   Contrasting information (e.g., \"Unlike the USA, Afghanistan does not grant citizenship based on birthplace\").\n\n3.  **Weakly Relevant Information:** Does any web page provide background context that is related but does not directly help answer the query?
