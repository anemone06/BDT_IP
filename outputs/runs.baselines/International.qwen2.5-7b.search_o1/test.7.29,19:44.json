However, they do mention some conditions for acquiring citizenship through residence.Supporting Quotes:1. From **Web Page 3**:   > \"Afghan nationality is granted to those residing in Afghanistan, born to Afghan parents, or born in Afghanistan to parents with one parent born in Afghanistan. ...\"2. From **Web Page 10**:   > \"Persons who reside in Afghanistan for five continuous or alternate years shall be considered as Afghan citizens provided that they have reached adulthood, have no criminal record, and have not been absent from the country for more than six months in each of the last three years.\"These quotes imply that while residence can lead to citizenship, it is not the primary method and comes with specific conditions. The principle of *jus sanguinis* appears to be more dominant.**Summary:**The information from the web pages indicates that Afghanistan primarily grants citizenship through descent (parents being Afghan citizens) rather than through residence or schooling. There are conditions for acquiring citizenship through residence, but they are not the main pathway. Therefore, the web pages provide a strongly relevant clue by indicating that birth in the territory alone is not sufficient, and that residence is a secondary condition with specific requirements.<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the information gathered, it seems that Afghanistan does not primarily allow for the acquisition of citizenship through residence or schooling for minors. The conditions for citizenship through residence are limited and not the main pathway for minors.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \\boxed{No}.",

However, none of the web pages directly state the conditions for acquiring citizenship through these relationships. Instead, they provide context and partial information that can be used to infer the conditions.**Key Findings:**1. **Jus Sanguinis Principle**: Several sources indicate that Afghan nationality law is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning citizenship is determined by the parents' nationality rather than place of birth.

Here are the key findings:1. **Web Page 2**: The Law on Citizenship of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan mentions that children born as a result of a marriage between an Afghan citizen and a foreign national can maintain their Afghan citizenship after the death of one of their parents. This implies that simply being a spouse, child, or grandchild of a deceased citizen is not sufficient for automatic citizenship.2. **Web Page 3**: The snippet from Wikipedia indicates that to acquire nationality by jus soli (birthright citizenship), a child must have one parent who was also born in Afghanistan and who had Afghan nationality. This further supports that simply being related to an Afghan citizen is not enough for automatic citizenship.3. **Web Page 6**: The snippet from Refworld states that the Law on Citizenship of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regulates the issues concerning acquiring or losing citizenship. This suggests that there are specific legal frameworks governing these situations, rather than automatic grants of citizenship based on familial relationships.4. **Web Page 9**: The law states that a foreign woman marrying an Afghan citizen can have her children from a previous marriage become Afghan citizens. This again implies that the relationship must meet specific criteria for citizenship to be granted.**Quote from Web Page 2:**\"2. Children born as a result of such marriage who are under 18 can maintain their. Afghan nationality after the death of one of their parents.\"These web pages collectively imply that the acquisition of citizenship by a spouse, child, or grandchild of a deceased citizen is not automatic and depends on specific legal conditions and relationships.<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the search results, it appears that the acquisition of citizenship by a spouse, child, or grandchild of a deceased citizen in Afghanistan is not automatic and is subject to specific conditions and relationships as outlined in the relevant laws.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}.",

However, Web Page 9 offers some relevant context about the citizenship status of a foreign woman whose husband is an Afghan citizen.Supporting Quote: \"A foreign woman whose husband is a citizen of Afghanistan does not automatically obtain Afghan citizenship under the 2000 legislation.\"**Analysis:**- **Web Page 1**: Contains an error and does not provide useful information.- **Web Page 2**: Provides information about applying for asylum and does not address citizenship laws for spouses.- **Web Page 3**: Mentions that wives of persons acquiring Afghan nationality will be considered Afghan subjects, but it does not explicitly state the conditions for the spouse of a person acquiring citizenship.- **Web Page 4**: Discusses the interpretation of Afghan nationality passing from parent to child but does not address the specific case of a spouse.- **Web Page 5**: Focuses on family reunification for U.S. citizens and their families, which is not directly relevant to the query.- **Web Page 6**: Mentions the acquisition of citizenship by various means but does not specify conditions for a spouse.- **Web Page 7**: Discusses the acquisition of citizenship by a foreign citizen who marries an Afghan national, but it does not clarify the conditions for the spouse.- **Web Page 8**: Is a report on the nationality of married women in different legal systems and does not provide specific information about Afghanistan’s laws regarding citizenship for spouses.- **Web Page 9**: Provides a relevant quote indicating that a foreign woman whose husband is an Afghan citizen does not automatically obtain Afghan citizenship under the 2000 legislation.

Specifically, the principle of *jus sanguinis* (right of blood) is mentioned, indicating that citizenship is primarily determined by the parents' nationality rather than the place of birth. Additionally, it is noted that a child can be Afghan if one of the parents is an Afghan citizen.Supporting Quotes:1. \"Afghan nationality is typically obtained under the principal of jus sanguinis, i.e. by birth to parents with Afghan nationality.\"2. \"A child will be Afghan citizen if both parents are Afghan citizens. Children will also be Afghan citizens in a situation where one of the parents is Afghan...\"3. \"Should a foreign woman marrying an Afghan citizen have children from any previous marriage with a foreign national, her children shall become Afghan citizens.\"These quotes suggest that a child can acquire Afghan citizenship if one of the parents is an Afghan citizen, but the specific conditions for naturalization of the parent are not explicitly detailed in these pages. Therefore, while the principle of *jus sanguinis* is clear, the exact conditions under which a parent can naturalize and transfer citizenship to a child are not fully addressed.<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears that Afghanistan does provide for the extension of citizenship to a child when one of the parents is acquiring citizenship, but the specific conditions for the parent's naturalization are not fully detailed in the search results.

Specifically, they suggest that a significant portion of Afghan refugees were admitted through parole and do not have a direct path to permanent residency, unlike those who might have received Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) or asylum.Supporting Quotes:1. \"The vast majority of Afghans who have relocated to the U.S. since late last July were admitted into the country on humanitarian parole. Parole is temporary without lasting protections for work or residency in the U.S.\"2. \"Afghans who were paroled into the U.S. on or after July 30, 2021, will be eligible for adjustment, as well as Afghans who were lawfully in the U.S. before the evacuation and Afghans whose travel to the U.S. was facilitated or coordinated by the American government.\"These quotes indicate that the pathway to permanent residency for many Afghan refugees is uncertain and likely more complex than for those who have received other forms of legal status.<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the search results, it appears that Afghan refugees have specific conditions for acquiring citizenship that differ from those for residence-based acquisition. The pathway to citizenship for many Afghan refugees is through parole, which is temporary and does not provide the same protections for work or residency as other forms of legal status.\n\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

However, several web pages provide information that significantly narrows down the possibilities and suggest that special achievements are not a primary path to citizenship.**Supporting Quotes:**1. From **Web Page 1**: \"To acquire nationality by jus soli, the law required a child who was born in the country to have one parent who was also born in Afghanistan and who had ...\". This suggests that jus soli (birthright citizenship) is not straightforward and may require certain conditions.2. From **Web Page 4**: \"Afghan citizenship may be obtained or lost in accordance with the provisions of the appropriate law.\" This indicates that the acquisition of citizenship is governed by specific laws, but does not specify special achievements.3. From **Web Page 5**: \"An eligible Afghan citizen may include a partner, dependent children and additional family members who are eligible under the ARAP in their application.\" This suggests that family relationships and certain vulnerabilities are the main criteria for relocation and settlement, not special achievements.4. From **Web Page 6**: \"To apply for Chief of Mission (COM) approval for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, you must have access to email, the ability to scan and save all of ...\". This web page describes a visa program for specific individuals, but does not mention general criteria for special achievements leading to citizenship.5. From **Web Page 7**: \"Afghan citizenship may be acquired upon fulfillment of the following conditions: Person was born in Afghanistan and has resided continually ...\". This further reinforces that birth and residency are primary conditions for citizenship, not special achievements.Given these findings, it appears that special achievements are not a recognized pathway to citizenship in Afghanistan. The primary pathways seem to be based on family relationships, birth, and residency.**Conclusion:**Based on the web pages analyzed, there is no direct evidence or strong clue suggesting that Afghanistan allows for citizenship to be acquired through special achievements. The information points to family-based and jus soli pathways as the primary means of obtaining citizenship.<|end_search_result|>\n\nGiven the information gathered, the answer to the question is that Afghanistan does not provide for acquisition of citizenship by a person who has special achievements.

Specifically, several web pages mention that marriage to an Albanian citizen can lead to the automatic acquisition of citizenship after a certain period of residency.**Quote:**- **Web Page 1:**  > A foreign national who has been married to an Albanian citizen for a period of no less than 3 (three) years may apply to acquire Albanian citizenship by ...- **Web Page 7:**  > Foreigners who have been married to Albanian citizens for three years or more can apply for citizenship by naturalisation if they have lived in ...- **Web Page 10:**  > The provisions of this law related to the stay and employment of the aliens shall not apply to the personnel of diplomatic missions and consular posts, for the members of United Nations missions and other specialized institutions of the United Nations, for the members of the international organizations and missions accredited in the Republic of Albania or for their family members.These quotes strongly suggest that after three years of marriage to an Albanian citizen, a foreign national can apply for citizenship. Therefore, the information provided is strongly relevant and implies that the query can be answered affirmatively.<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the information found, it appears that Albania does provide for the acquisition of citizenship by the spouse or registered partner of a person who is already a citizen, with the condition that the marriage must be of a certain duration (at least three years in this case).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

However, they do provide relevant details that can be used to infer the conditions.**Key Findings:**1. **Citizenship by Birth:**    - Children born in Albania to at least one parent with Albanian citizenship automatically acquire Albanian citizenship.   - If a child is born or found in Albania and may remain stateless, they can be granted Albanian citizenship.   - If a child's parents become legally recognized before the child reaches 14 years of age and the parents are foreign citizens, they may apply for the revocation of the child's Albanian citizenship on condition that the child does not remain stateless.2. **Naturalization:**   - For naturalization, the law does not explicitly mention the condition of a parent acquiring citizenship. However, it does state that a foreigner who has submitted an application for naturalization must meet several criteria, including having resided in the territory of the Republic of Albania for at least 5 years.3. **Adoption:**   - If a child is adopted by Albanian citizens, they acquire Albanian citizenship. If only one of the foster parents is Albanian, both parents must agree, and the child must reside in Albania.**Supporting Quotes:**- \"Anyone born, having even one of the parents with Albanian citizenship, automatically acquires Albanian citizenship and registers as an Albanian citizen.\" - [Acquisition of Albanian Citizenship - ARS Legal & Financial Services]- \"A child born or found in the territory of Albania and may remain stateless, shall be granted Albanian citizenship.\" - [Acquisition of Albanian Citizenship - ARS Legal & Financial Services]- \"A child born or found in the territory of the Republic of Albania acquires Albanian citizenship if he is born from unknown parents and would consequently become stateless.\" - [Law on Albanian Citizenship | Refworld]**Output:****Final Information**The web pages provide information about the acquisition of Albanian citizenship by children, particularly in cases involving a parent acquiring citizenship. While they do not directly state the conditions for a child acquiring Albanian citizenship when a parent acquires it, they do offer relevant information that can be used to infer the conditions. Specifically, children born in Albania to at least one parent with Albanian citizenship automatically acquire Albanian citizenship, and if a child is found in Albania and may remain stateless, they can be granted Albanian citizenship. Additionally, if a child's parents become legally recognized before the child reaches 14 years of age and the parents are foreign citizens, they may apply for the revocation of the child's Albanian citizenship on condition that the child does not remain stateless.Supporting Quotes:- \"Anyone born, having even one of the parents with Albanian citizenship, automatically acquires Albanian citizenship and registers as an Albanian citizen.\"- \"A child born or found in the territory of Albania and may remain stateless, shall be granted Albanian citizenship.\"- \"A child born or found in the territory of the Republic of Albania acquires Albanian citizenship if he is born from unknown parents and would consequently become stateless.\"<|end_search_result|>\n\nBased on the information provided, Albania does provide for extending the acquisition of citizenship to the child of a person who is acquiring citizenship, particularly if the child is born in Albania to at least one parent with Albanian citizenship. The specific conditions include the child automatically acquiring Albanian citizenship if born in Albania to at least one parent with Albanian citizenship, and the child being granted Albanian citizenship if found in Albania and may remain stateless.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

        "Output": "To answer this question, I need to find out Albania's citizenship laws specifically for stateless or undetermined citizenship individuals and compare them with the general conditions for residence-based acquisition of citizenship.\n\nAssistant:\n<|begin_search_query|>Albania citizenship laws for stateless or undetermined citizenship individuals<|end_search_query|>\n\n<|begin_search_result|>The web pages provide information that strongly implies the answer to the query. Specifically, they indicate that children born in Albania to unknown or stateless parents are considered Albanian citizens, which strongly suggests that stateless or undetermined citizenship individuals can acquire Albanian citizenship through birth in the territory.**Supporting Quotes:**1. From Web Page 1:   - \"Children born within Albanian territory to unknown or stateless parents are considered Albanian citizens.\"   - \"Children found within Albanian territory with unknown parentage are presumed to be Albanian citizens unless proven otherwise.\"2. From Web Page 2:   - \"A person born in Albania to non-Albanian parents is an Albanian citizen if that person: Holds no other nationality at the time of birth (i.e., is stateless)...\"3. From Web Page 6:   - \"A child born or found in Albania whose parents are unknown shall be deemed to be an Albanian national if the identity of the parents is not established before he reaches the age of fourteen years.\"These quotes directly support the conclusion that stateless or undetermined citizenship individuals can acquire Albanian citizenship through birth in the territory.<|end_search_result|>\n\nAssistant:\nBased on the search results, it appears that Albania does provide specific conditions for the acquisition of citizenship by a person in its territory who is stateless or of undetermined citizenship. These conditions include children born in Albania to unknown or stateless parents being considered Albanian citizens.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is \\boxed{Yes}.",

However, they provide information that strongly implies that special provisions exist for certain categories, but do not explicitly state the conditions for citizenship by special achievements.**Summary of Key Findings:**- The law in Albania allows for special provisions for acquiring citizenship, particularly for those with special merits, such as significant contributions to the country in fields like science, economy, culture, or sports.- There is a special procedure for granting citizenship to individuals who have urgent interests of the state, although the exact conditions are not specified.**Quote from Web Pages:**- \"Albanian citizenship may be granted to a foreign citizen over 18 (eighteen) years of age, provided that he or she does not pose a threat to the public order and national security of the Republic of Albania as well as in cases where this is in the national interest, or in the interest of education, science, art, culture, economy, and sport in the Republic of Albania.\"- \"Albanian nationality may be acquired by special procedure if the urgent interests of the State make such naturalization desirable. In such cases the alien shall be exempted from the conditions of article 7, paragraphs 1 and 2.\"These quotes suggest that special provisions exist for certain categories, but the exact conditions for citizenship by special achievements are not clearly stated in the provided web pages.<|end_search_result|>\n\nGiven the information from the search results, while it is clear that Albania has provisions for special provisions for acquiring citizenship, the specific conditions for citizenship by special achievements are not explicitly detailed in the search results. However, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that such conditions exist, even if they are not fully specified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",
