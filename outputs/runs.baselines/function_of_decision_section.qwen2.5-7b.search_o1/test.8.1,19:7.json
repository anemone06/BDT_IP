By extension, “where the district court is sentencing outside the guidelines range, it is particularly important that the district court have discretion to reevaluate the entire sentencing package.” Id.

After a few hours of investigation, the MSHA Inspector allowed mine operations to resume and subsequently limited the Order to a single piece of equipment. MSHA eventually terminated the modified Order but M-Class still sought vacatur, arguing MSHA had erroneously issued the Order. After an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the Order, the Commission vacated it, concluding substantial evidence—including information MSHA did not know at the time the Order issued—did *20 **392 not support a finding that an accident had occurred.

The paragraph is: \"Khochinsky submits that the term “abuse of process” for purposes of § 1605(a)(5)(B) refers solely to abuse of judicial process, whereas extradition is a diplomatic process. But as the Ninth Circuit observed in Blaxland, a claim against a foreign state for wrongfully “invoking the extradition procedures” involves an “abuse of process” within the meaning of § 1605(a)(5)(B). Blaxland, 323 F.3d at 1204. Whether the term “abuse of process” is “defined according to a uniform federal standard or according to applicable state law”—here, District of Columbia or New York law—the term “concern[s] the wrongful use of legal process,” including an alleged effort to “misuse[ ] legal procedures to detain” or “extradite” someone. Id. at 1204, 1206; see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682 (1977) (defining tort of abuse of process); Doe v. District of Columbia, 796 F.3d 96, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (same under D.C. law); Curiano v. Suozzi, 63 N.Y.2d 113, 480 N.Y.S.2d 466, 469 N.E.2d 1324, 1326 (1984) (same under N.Y. law). And Khochinsky is wrong, moreover, insofar as he assumes that extradition is an exclusively diplomatic process, to the complete exclusion of any judicial role: while extradition, as we have explained, is fundamentally diplomatic in character, it ultimately involves the courts in some measure in its execution—as evidenced by the termination of the extradition proceedings in this case upon a judicial determination that probable cause was lacking.\" What is the function of this paragraph?\n\nChoices:\nFacts\nProcedural History\nIssue\nRule\nAnalysis\nConclusion\nDecree\n\nCitation: 1 F.4th 1\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The paragraph begins by quoting Article III of the United States Constitution, which is not the main focus but rather a foundational principle.\n2. It then references several court cases (J.T. v. District of Columbia, McBryde v. Comm. to Rev. Cir. Council Conduct, Clarke v. United States) to support a legal principle.\n3. The paragraph provides a direct quote from a case (J.T. v. District of Columbia, 983 F.3d 516, 522) stating the specific legal principle: \"only actual, ongoing controversies\" can be reviewed.\n4. It further elaborates on the principle by quoting another case (Clarke v. United States, 915 F.2d 699, 701) to provide additional context and support for the rule.\n\nGiven the content, the paragraph is clearly stating a legal rule that the court is applying. It is not merely stating facts, describing procedural history, providing analysis, drawing a conclusion, or issuing a decree.\n\nTherefore, the function of this paragraph is to state a rule.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{Rule}",

Shortly thereafter, the physician notified the police that a miner was suffering from CO poisoning and recommended that the mine be shut down. The police called the MSHA hotline and relayed the physician's diagnosis and recommendation, which the MSHA hotline employees used to draft an escalation report.2 The report was then sent to the local MSHA office.

While the officers checked for victims, a dispatcher reported over their radio that citizens on neighboring blocks were calling 911 to report gunshots heard at either end of the 3500 block. App. 66.

Wyoming Fuel Co., 14 FMSHRC 1282, 1288–89 (1992), and Secretary of Labor v. Ten-A-Coal Co., 14 FMSHRC 1296, 1298 (1992). Wyoming Fuel Co. and Ten-A-Coal Co. indicate that a citation issued under § 104 of the Mine Act can be modified after termination, not that a § 103(k) safety order can be so modified. We agree with the Secretary that § 104 citations—and withdrawal orders—are distinguishable from § 103(k) safety orders. Pet'r’s Suppl. Br. 3–5. Termination of a § 104(a) citation signifies that the violative condition has abated and that the mine operator is no longer subject to a § 104(b) withdrawal order for failure to abate but “not that the citation itself no longer exists for other legal purposes ... [such as] subsequent contest and civil penalty proceedings.” Wyoming Fuel Co., 14 FMSHRC at 1288. There are no analogous citations or penalty proceedings under § 103(k). The functional difference between termination and vacatur in the context of a § 104 citation does not mean a terminated § 103(k) safety order—rather than a vacated § 103(k) safety order—threatens non-speculative legal consequences for the mine operator. Neither the Commission nor M-Class has identified any statutory basis for conversion of a § 103(k) safety order to a § 104 citation or withdrawal order.7 That MSHA—while investigating  *24  **396 an accident after issuing a § 103(k) safety order—could note a health or safety violation and issue a citation under § 104 does not mean that a terminated § 103(k) safety order can serve as the basis for a later citation or be modified after termination.\" What is the function of this paragraph?\n\nChoices:\nFacts\nProcedural History\nIssue\nRule\nAnalysis\nConclusion\nDecree\n\nCitation: 1 F.4th 16\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

During this period, MSHA initially insisted that M-Class submit an action plan governing  *21  **393 diesel air compressor use in the mine before the Order would be terminated. After MSHA rejected M-Class's submission and the parties could not agree on a plan, M-Class filed a notice of contest and moved for an expedited hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ shortly thereafter denied M-Class's expedition motion and a few days later MSHA terminated the Order. Approximately two and one-half months after terminating the Order, the Secretary moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction and mootness because the Order had been terminated. The ALJ denied the motion, concluding his jurisdiction continued and the case was not moot. After a hearing, the ALJ concluded “the Secretary ha[d] proven by a preponderance of the evidence that an accident [had] occurred and that the [terminated] Order was appropriate to ensure the safety of other miners until the investigation ... was completed.” M-Class Mining, LLC v. Sec'y of Labor, 41 FMSHRC 1, 10 (2019) (ALJ). M-Class timely petitioned the Commission for review of the ALJ's decision. In a 3–2 decision, the Commission affirmed the ALJ in part and reversed in part.

See Marvel Characters, 726 F.3d at 143 (suggesting that a freelancer's assignments could be “redundancies insisted upon by [the hiring party] to protect its rights” rather than an indication that the  *86 hiring party “did not already own the rights”). This reading is supported by the tentative, open-ended language (“to which he may be entitled,” “any such copyright”) (emphasis added), which appears to be an attempt to cover all conceivable bases without acknowledging that any rights actually belong to Markham. Regardless, this language is not the required “express contractual reservation of the copyright in the artist.” Lin-Brook, 352 F.2d at 300. The district court thus supportably found that the assignment agreement did not overcome the presumption that the game was a work for hire made for Klamer. As a result, Markham “never owned the copyrights to assign,” and “there are no rights the assignment of which his ... heirs may now terminate.” Marvel Characters, 726 F.3d at 137.8\" What is the function of this paragraph?\n\nChoices:\nFacts\nProcedural History\nIssue\nRule\nAnalysis\nConclusion\nDecree\n\nCitation: 1 F.4th 75\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Output": "Let's analyze the paragraph step by step to determine its function.\n\n1. The paragraph begins by mentioning that the Commission published a modified version of the proposed order, which is referred to as the Governance Order. This is a factual statement about an action taken by the Commission.\n\n2. The paragraph then discusses the Commission's requirements for the forthcoming proposal, including specific features that must be included. This is more than just a fact; it describes the procedural steps and requirements set by the Commission.\n\n3. The paragraph provides specific details about these requirements, such as the \"voting representation\" and \"voting rights\" allocation, which are part of the procedural requirements set by the Commission.\n\nGiven this analysis, the paragraph is primarily describing a procedural action taken by the Commission and the requirements set for a forthcoming proposal. This aligns with the definition of Procedural History, which includes the sequence of events and actions taken in the legal process.\n\nTherefore, the function of this paragraph is \\boxed{Procedural History}.",
