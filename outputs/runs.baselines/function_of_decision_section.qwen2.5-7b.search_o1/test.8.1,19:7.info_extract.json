    "prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n**Task Instruction:**\n\nYou are an expert evaluator. Your task is to analyze web pages and determine if they contain information that helps answer a question, based on the reasoning steps so far.\n\n**Evaluation Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Direct Answer:** Does any web page directly answer the **Current Search Query**? (e.g., \"Yes, Afghanistan grants citizenship by birth\" or \"No, it does not.\")\n\n2.  **Strongly Relevant Clue:** If there is no direct answer, does any web page provide information that **logically implies** an answer or **significantly narrows down the possibilities**? This includes:\n    *   Information about the underlying principles (e.g., \"The law is based on jus sanguinis/right of blood\").\n    *   Descriptions of necessary conditions that contradict the query (e.g., \"Citizenship requires at least one parent to be a citizen\").\n    *   Contrasting information (e.g., \"Unlike the USA, Afghanistan does not grant citizenship based on birthplace\").\n\n3.  **Weakly Relevant Information:** Does any web page provide background context that is related but does not directly help answer the query? (e.g., general history of the law, unrelated clauses).\n\n4.  **No Helpful Information:** The web pages contain no information relevant to the query.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nBased on your analysis, provide your output in one of the following formats.\n\n- **If the web pages contain a Direct Answer or a Strongly Relevant Clue:**\n    - Start with `**Final Information**`.\n    - **Summarize the key findings** that directly help continue the reasoning.\n    - **Quote the most important sentence(s)** from the web pages that support your summary.\n\n**Example for Strongly Relevant Clue:**\n**Final Information**\n\nThe web pages indicate that Afghan nationality law is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning citizenship is determined by the parents' nationality, not the place of birth. This strongly suggests that birth in the territory alone is not sufficient.\n\nSupporting Quote: \"Afghan nationality is typically obtained under the principal of jus sanguinis, ie by birth to parents with Afghan nationality.\"\n\n- **If the web pages only contain Weakly Relevant Information or No Helpful Information:**\n**Final Information**\n\nNo helpful information found.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  \nStep 1: The paragraph states: \"For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Jones's motion to suppress.\" This sentence is providing the final judgment or decision in the case. It is not detailing the facts, procedural history, or discussing an issue or rule. It is also not offering an analysis or conclusion that leads to the final decision. Instead, it is stating the court's decision directly.\n\nStep 2: To determine the function of this paragraph, I will perform a search to confirm the classification.\n\nStep 3: Assistant:\n\nStep 4: <|begin_search_query|>definition of Conclusion in legal written opinions<|end_search_query|>\n\n- **Current Search Query:**  \ndefinition of Conclusion in legal written opinions\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**  \n**Web Page 1:**\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Legal Conclusion - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/legal-conclusion\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"A 'Legal Conclusion' is a decision reached by the jury based on the judge's instructions regarding the applicable law and the evidence presented during a trial.\",\n  \"context\": \"{\\\"data\\\":null,\\\"code\\\":402,\\\"name\\\":\\\"InsufficientBalanceError\\\",\\\"status\\\":40203,\\\"message\\\":\\\"Account balance not enough to run this query, please recharge.\\\",\\\"readableMessage\\\":\\\"InsufficientBalanceError: Account balance not enough to run this query, please recharge.\\\"}\"\n}\n**Web Page 2:**\n{\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"title\": \"conclusion | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conclusion\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"A conclusion is the final part of a speech or writing; the closing.
