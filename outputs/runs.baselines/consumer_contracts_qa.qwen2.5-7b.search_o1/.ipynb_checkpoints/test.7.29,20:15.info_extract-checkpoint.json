    "prompt": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n**Task Instruction:**\n\nYou are an expert evaluator. Your task is to analyze web pages and determine if they contain information that helps answer a question, based on the reasoning steps so far.\n\n**Evaluation Guidelines:**\n\n1.  **Direct Answer:** Does any web page directly answer the **Current Search Query**? (e.g., \"Yes, Afghanistan grants citizenship by birth\" or \"No, it does not.\")\n\n2.  **Strongly Relevant Clue:** If there is no direct answer, does any web page provide information that **logically implies** an answer or **significantly narrows down the possibilities**? This includes:\n    *   Information about the underlying principles (e.g., \"The law is based on jus sanguinis/right of blood\").\n    *   Descriptions of necessary conditions that contradict the query (e.g., \"Citizenship requires at least one parent to be a citizen\").\n    *   Contrasting information (e.g., \"Unlike the USA, Afghanistan does not grant citizenship based on birthplace\").\n\n3.  **Weakly Relevant Information:** Does any web page provide background context that is related but does not directly help answer the query? (e.g., general history of the law, unrelated clauses).\n\n4.  **No Helpful Information:** The web pages contain no information relevant to the query.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nBased on your analysis, provide your output in one of the following formats.\n\n- **If the web pages contain a Direct Answer or a Strongly Relevant Clue:**\n    - Start with `**Final Information**`.\n    - **Summarize the key findings** that directly help continue the reasoning.\n    - **Quote the most important sentence(s)** from the web pages that support your summary.\n\n**Example for Strongly Relevant Clue:**\n**Final Information**\n\nThe web pages indicate that Afghan nationality law is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning citizenship is determined by the parents' nationality, not the place of birth. This strongly suggests that birth in the territory alone is not sufficient.\n\nSupporting Quote: \"Afghan nationality is typically obtained under the principal of jus sanguinis, ie by birth to parents with Afghan nationality.\"\n\n- **If the web pages only contain Weakly Relevant Information or No Helpful Information:**\n**Final Information**\n\nNo helpful information found.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  \nStep 1: To determine if eBay ever does robocalls, I need to analyze the provided context and any additional information from a search.\n\n...\n\nStep 5: I will search for more details about eBay's practices regarding robocalls.\n\nStep 6: Assistant:\n\nStep 7: <|begin_search_query|>eBay robocalls user agreement<|end_search_query|>\n\n- **Current Search Query:**  \neBay robocalls user agreement\n\n- **Searched Web Pages:**  \n**Web Page 1:**\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"User Agreement - eBay\",\n  \"url\": \"https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\",\n  \"site_name\": \"\",\n  \"date\": \"\",\n  \"snippet\": \"For users who agreed to a prior version of our User Agreement, this agreement is effective as of August 28, 2025.
