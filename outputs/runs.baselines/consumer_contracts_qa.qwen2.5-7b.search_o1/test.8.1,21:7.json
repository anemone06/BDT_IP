DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: Introduction\nThank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform (collectively, the Service).  \n\nOur Service\nThe Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and small. We provide lots of information about our products and how to use them in our Help Center. Among other things, you can find out about YouTube Kids, the YouTube Partner Program and YouTube Paid Memberships and Purchases (where available).You can also read all about enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games console, or Google Home.\n\nYour Service Provider\nThe entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as YouTube, we, us, or our). References to YouTubes Affiliates in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).\n\nApplicable Terms\nYour use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies which may be updated from time to time (together, this \"Agreement\"). Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.\n\nPlease read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.\n\nWho may use the Service?\nAge Requirements\nYou must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. However, children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nPermission by Parent or Guardian\nIf you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardians permission to use the Service. Please have them read this Agreement with you.\nIf you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your childs activity on the Service.

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if minors require parental permission to access YouTube's services, let's analyze the provided context step by step.\n\n1. **Age Requirements**: The context clearly states, \"You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service.\" This sets the minimum age requirement for using YouTube.\n\n2. **Children Under 18**: The text mentions, \"However, children of all ages may use YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.\" This indicates that there is a specific service (YouTube Kids) designed for younger users, but it requires parental or guardian permission to use.\n\n3. **Permission by Parent or Guardian**: For users under 18 who are not using YouTube Kids, the context states, \"If you are under 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardians permission to use the Service.\" This directly confirms that minors who are not using YouTube Kids need parental permission to access the full YouTube service.\n\n4. **Businesses**: The context also mentions, \"If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you represent that you have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that such entity accepts this Agreement.\" This is relevant for business users but does not apply to minors.\n\nBased on the provided information, minors require parental permission to access YouTube's services, unless they are using the YouTube Kids service, which also requires parental permission to enable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) or the law.

You also have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.\n\nRemoval of Content By YouTube\nIf we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.

You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.\n\nTerminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause\nYouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google accounts access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.\n\nTerminations by YouTube for Service Changes\nYouTube may terminate your access, or your Google accounts access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. \n\nNotice for Termination or Suspension\nWe will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.\n\nEffect of Account Suspension or Termination\nIf your Google account is terminated or your Google accounts access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.\n\nQuestion: Does Youtube permit a user to download his or her data prior to such user ceasing to use Youtube?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: Downloadable Software\nWhen the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTubes written permission.\n\nOpen Source\nSome software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.\n\nQuestion: Is Youtube authorized to carry out updates to its software without requiring the permission of users? \n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if YouTube is authorized to carry out updates to its software without requiring the permission of users, let's analyze the given context step by step.\n\n1. **Automatic Updates**: The context states, \"you give permission for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings.\" This implies that users have already given permission for automatic updates.\n\n2. **License Terms**: The context mentions, \"YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service.\" This license is granted for the sole purpose of enabling users to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube.\n\n3. **Purpose of the License**: The license is specifically for the purpose of using the Service as provided by YouTube, and it does not explicitly prohibit automatic updates.\n\n4. **Open Source Considerations**: The context also mentions that some software used in the Service may be offered under an open source license. However, it states that there may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific terms of the open source license in question.\n\nGiven these points, the primary authorization for automatic updates comes from the user's permission to allow automatic updates, which is part of the broader license agreement. The open source licenses mentioned do not necessarily override this permission, as they may have specific terms that do not affect the user's permission for automatic updates.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, YouTube is authorized to carry out updates to its software without requiring the permission of users, as long as this update permission is part of the user's agreement.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}",

At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center .\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS\nAmazon attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Amazon does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Amazon Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Amazon itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.\n\nPRICING\n\"List Price\" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on Amazon and other retailers. Certain products may have a \"Was Price\" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on Amazon.\nWith respect to items sold by Amazon, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Amazon is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To answer this question, let's analyze the provided context step by step:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss**: The risk of loss and title for physical items pass to the customer upon delivery to the carrier. This implies that the customer is responsible for the item from the moment it is delivered.\n\n2. **Returns, Refunds and Title**: Amazon does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at their fulfillment center. For items where a refund is issued without a return, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. This suggests that in some cases, Amazon may issue a refund without the item being returned, but the title of the item does not transfer back to Amazon.\n\n3. **Product Descriptions and Pricing**: The context mentions that Amazon attempts to be accurate but does not warrant the accuracy of product descriptions or prices. If a product is not as described, the customer's sole remedy is to return it in unused condition. For pricing, if the correct price is higher than the stated price, Amazon may contact the customer for instructions or cancel the order. However, there is no mention of direct reimbursement without a return.\n\n4. **Pricing and Mispricings**: Amazon does not confirm the price of an item until after the order is placed. If a product is mispriced, Amazon may contact the customer for instructions or cancel the order. There is no indication that Amazon will directly reimburse a customer without a return in such cases.\n\nBased on the provided information, the context does not explicitly mention instances where Amazon may reimburse a customer without the item being returned. The closest scenario would be a refund without a return, but this is not a reimbursement for the item itself, but rather a refund of the purchase price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}.",

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nWe each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nBy using any Amazon Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Amazon.\n\nQuestion: If I want to make a claim against Amazon, do I generally have to do this by arbitration (instead of court)?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.\n\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.\n\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We dont share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission.

DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.\n\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested.\n\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We dont share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here.\n\nWe collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.\n\nQuestion: Does Facebook undertake to refrain from providing advertisers with personal data that would have the effect of divulging the specific identity of a given individual?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

        "Output": "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the context:\n\n1. **Privacy Protection**: Facebook emphasizes that protecting people's privacy is central to their ad system design.\n2. **Data Sharing with Advertisers**: Advertisers can provide information such as their business goals and the kind of audience they want to target. Facebook then shows their ads to people who might be interested based on the provided criteria.\n3. **Anonymized Reporting**: Facebook provides advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads, which include general demographic and interest information. This information is used to help advertisers understand how people are interacting with their content.\n4. **No Direct Personal Data Sharing**: Facebook does not share information that directly identifies an individual (such as name or email address) unless the user gives specific permission.\n\nBased on these points, Facebook does not share personal data that would have the effect of divulging the specific identity of a given individual, unless the user gives specific permission.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if there are circumstances in which Facebook may suspend or terminate account access without informing the affected user, let's analyze the provided context step by step.\n\n1. **Account Suspension or Termination Context**:\n   - Facebook may suspend or permanently disable access to your account if you have clearly, seriously, or repeatedly breached their Terms or Policies, including Community Standards.\n   - They may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or if required by law.\n   - Facebook will let you know and explain any options you have to request a review unless doing so may expose them or others to legal liability, harm the community of users, compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of their services, systems, or Products, or where they are restricted due to technical limitations or prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\n\n2. **Specific Conditions for Notifying the User**:\n   - Facebook will notify you by email or through their Products at least 30 days before making changes to the Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect.\n   - If the account suspension or termination is due to actions that may expose Facebook or others to legal liability, harm the community, compromise the integrity of their services, or where they are restricted due to technical limitations or prohibited from doing so for legal reasons, they may not inform the user.\n\nBased on the provided context, the answer to the question is that there are indeed circumstances in which Facebook may suspend or terminate account access without informing the affected user. Specifically, this would be the case if the suspension or termination is due to actions that may expose Facebook or others to legal liability, harm the community, compromise the integrity of their services, or where they are restricted due to technical limitations or prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if Verizon is entitled to require users to pay a fee to access the services, let's analyze the provided context step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Access**: The context does not explicitly state that there is a fee for initial access to the services. It mentions that users are permitted to use the services under applicable law, and there is no direct statement about a fee for accessing the services.\n\n2. **Fees for Use or Access**: The context specifically states: \"We reserve the right to charge fees for use of or access to the Services (and any associated support), whether currently in existence or not, in our sole discretion. If we decide to charge fees, our payment terms will apply and we will provide you with prior notice.\"\n\n3. **Discretionary Authority**: This statement indicates that Verizon has the discretionary authority to charge fees for the use or access to the services. The use of \"we reserve the right\" suggests that this is a permissible action under the terms of service.\n\n4. **Prior Notice**: The context also mentions that if Verizon decides to charge fees, it will provide prior notice. This ensures that users are informed before any changes in pricing.\n\nBased on the provided context, Verizon is indeed entitled to require users to pay a fee to access the services, as long as it adheres to the terms of service, including providing prior notice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

        "Output": "To answer this question, let's break down the context provided and analyze the relevant parts step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context:**\n   - The context is from a legal disclaimer provided by Verizon Media Entities (Verizon and its affiliates).\n   - The disclaimer covers various aspects of the services provided, including warranties and representations.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relevant Parts:**\n   - The disclaimer states: \"WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES AS-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND AS AVAILABLE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WE DO NOT REPRESENT, PROMISE, OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.\"\n   - This part indicates that Verizon is not guaranteeing the reliability, security, or error-free nature of the services.\n\n   - The disclaimer also mentions: \"YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NO DATA TRANSMISSION OVER THE INTERNET OR INFORMATION STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE GUARANTEED TO BE SECURE, AND WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THAT EFFECT.\"\n   - This explicitly states that Verizon is not guaranteeing the security of data transmission or storage.\n\n   - The disclaimer further states: \"WE MAKE NO COMMITMENTS, PROMISES OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES OR CONTENT LINKED FROM THE SERVICES, THE SUPPORT WE PROVIDE FOR THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, THE SECURITY OF THE SERVICES, OR THE SERVICES RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS, PROVIDE CERTAIN OUTPUTS OR ACHIEVE CERTAIN RESULTS.\"\n   - This part emphasizes that Verizon is not making any promises or warranties about the content, support, functions, security, reliability, quality, accuracy, availability, or ability of the services to meet user needs.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the explicit statements in the disclaimer, Verizon is not promising or warranting the security or reliability of data transmission or storage. Therefore, it can be inferred that Verizon is not taking responsibility for data that is deleted, as it is not making any promises or guarantees about the security or reliability of the services.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}",

The context states that Verizon Media Entities (which includes Verizon) do not make any representations, promises, or warranties, express or implied, about the services. This means they are not promising anything about the services, including data deletion.\n\n2. It explicitly mentions that they provide the services \"as-is, with all faults, and as available\" and that \"your use of the services, including content within the services, is at your own risk.\"\n\n3. The context also mentions that they do not guarantee the security of data transmission over the internet or information storage technology. This implies that they do not promise to protect data from deletion or loss.\n\n4. The section specifically mentions that they do not make any commitments, promises, or warranties about the content within the services, the support they provide, the specific functions of the services, the security of the services, or the services' reliability, quality, accuracy, availability, or ability to meet your needs, provide certain outputs, or achieve certain results.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the provided context does limit Verizon's liability with respect to the deletion of data.

DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: Fee-Based Services and Billing. Unless otherwise specified in the additional terms that apply to the Services you are using, the terms in this Section 11 apply to you.\n\nWe offer products and subscriptions for a fee (fee-based Services). These fee-based Services are governed by the additional terms you agree to when you register for the fee-based Service and these Terms. If you register for a fee-based Service, you must designate a payment method and provide us with accurate billing and payment information and you have the continuing obligation to keep it up to date. Many fee-based Services require you to have, or register for, a Yahoo, AOL or other Verizon Media ID. If you are an AOL Dial-Up customer, please see additional terms by clicking here.\n\nThe following important provisions apply to all of our fee-based services:\n\nThird-Party products. If the fee-based Service includes a third-party product, you understand and agree that your purchase and use of the Service is also subject to the third partys terms of service and privacy policy, which you should read thoroughly before agreeing to them.\n\nPayments. You represent that you are at least the minimum age required to enter into a legal agreement. You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.\n\nPayment Methods. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services. You are responsible for all charges even if your payment method fails or is denied. You authorize and direct us to retain all information about any payment method(s) associated with your account. We may import payment information you entered during a prior purchase and provide you the option to use that payment information during purchase of a new product. You permit us to obtain and use updated information from the issuer of your payment method in accordance with the policies and procedures of any applicable card brands. We may in some instances continue charging a payment method past its expiration date at our discretion and subject to the payment processors' or issuing bank's approval. Surcharges may apply if you use certain payment methods, such as payment from your checking or savings account.\n\nPayment Terms. We may charge for fee-based Services in advance and on a daily, monthly, yearly, lump sum, or other basis in accordance with the stated terms, as long as your subscription remains active, even if you have not downloaded or used the Service or accessed your online account.\n\nAuto-Renewal. We use auto-renewal for many of our fee-based Services. At the expiration of each subscription term for such fee-based Services, we will automatically renew your subscription and charge the credit card or other payment method you have provided to us, unless you cancel your subscription at least 48 hours before the end of the current period. Unless otherwise stated in Section 14, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the then-current price, excluding promotional and discount pricing. We may, in our sole discretion, post charges to your payment method individually or aggregate charges for some or all of your fee-based Services with us.\n\nFraud Protection. We may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us, including debiting amounts less than $1.00 from your credit card and then immediately crediting it back. You authorize us to do so for verification and anti-fraud purposes.\n\nFree Trials. We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation (\"Free Trial\"). Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled. If you are not satisfied with a particular fee-based Service, you must cancel the subscription before the Free Trial ends to avoid charges. We reserve the right to limit you to one free trial or promotion of a fee-based Service and to prohibit the combining of free trials or other promotional offers.\n\nNo Refunds. All charges are nonrefundable unless provided otherwise in the terms you agree to when you register for a fee-based Service, unless stated differently for your country in Section 14 or as otherwise specified below.\n\nTermination. We, in our sole discretion, may change, discontinue or terminate any or all aspects of a fee-based Service without notice, including access to support services, content and other products or services ancillary to the fee-based Service, subject to providing an appropriate refund for any portions of a specified but no longer available term. You may cancel a fee-based Service at any time by logging into your online account and terminating the subscription.\n\nChange in Fees and Billing Method. We may change our fees and billing methods at any time. We will provide you with notice of any price increase at least thirty (30) days in advance. Subject to applicable law, (i) if you disagree with any proposed change, your sole remedy is to cancel your fee-based Service before the price change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.\n\nDelinquency. After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.\n\n90-Day Notice Period. You must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement. If you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.\n\nQuestion: Can Verizon sometimes charge my credit card even after its expired?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

This suggests that even if a card is expired, Verizon might still attempt to verify its validity before charging.\n\nBased on the provided information, it appears that Verizon can charge a credit card even after it has expired, provided that the payment processor or issuing bank approves this action and that Verizon has the authorization from the user to do so.

Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any third partys websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.\n\nThe Services may also contain sponsored Third-Party Content or advertisements.

Your Promotion must state that the Promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit, and the rules for your Promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Reddit from any liability related to the Promotion.\n\nQuestion: Does Reddit permit the use of its services for the purpose of hosting competitions or similar activities?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

This is not under Reddit's control, and they are not responsible for any third-party content. This part is about third-party content and does not directly address hosting competitions.\n\n2. **Advertisements**: The Services may contain sponsored third-party content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and Reddit may place advertisements in connection with any content or information on the Services. This again does not directly address hosting competitions.\n\n3. **Promotions**: The Services may be used to conduct promotions, including contests or sweepstakes. However, the context explicitly states that if you choose to use the Services to conduct a promotion, you are responsible for conducting the Promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, the promotion must state that it is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit, and the rules for the promotion must require each entrant or participant to release Reddit from any liability related to the promotion.\n\nFrom the given context, it is clear that Reddit does permit the use of its services for the purpose of hosting competitions or similar activities, but with certain conditions. The user must ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and must take responsibility for the promotion. They must also ensure that the promotion is clearly stated as not being sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with Reddit, and include a release of liability for Reddit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}. DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.\n\nYou agree to the following licensing requirements:\n\na. Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License (CC BY-SA), and\nGNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).\n(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)\n\nThe only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you contribute under that particular license. For example, at the publication of this version of the Terms of Use, English Wikinews mandates that all text content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Generic License (CC BY 2.5) and does not require a dual license with GFDL.\n\nPlease note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.\n\nb. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due  to authors like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions:\ni. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nii. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\niii. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\n\nc. Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)(\"CC BY-SA\"). Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.\n\nYou agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying), it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license), and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.\n\nd. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy, and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to that Project.\n\ne. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license, you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Wikimedia Projects or features, even if you terminate use of our services.\n\nf. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to label it appropriately.\ng. Re-use: Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though exceptions exist for content contributed under \"fair use\" or similar exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the underlying license(s).\n\nWhen you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions:\ni. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all authors and editors);\nii. Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or\niii. Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions).\n\nIf the text content was imported from another source, it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in Importing text, above). In that case, you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to re-license it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.\n\nIn addition, please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, re-users should preserve them.\n\nFor any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses.\n\nh. Modifications or additions to material that you re-use: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).\n\nWhen modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available.\n\nWith both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using text content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under, along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself.\n\nQuestion: Can things I write for Wikipedia be used by other people or organizations for commercial purposes?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.\n\nTo ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).\n\n14. Disclaimers\nHighlighted for emphasis\n\nAt the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.\n\nWe are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.\n\nAny material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.\n\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.\n\n15. Limitation on Liability\nHighlighted for emphasis\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate.

It does not directly address the safety of services, but it does indicate that legal claims must be filed in a specific court and under specific laws.\n\n2. **Disclaimers (Section 14)**:\n   - This section explicitly states that the services are provided \"as is\" and \"as available,\" and that all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, are disclaimed.\n   - It also mentions that the Wikimedia Foundation is not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties.\n   - Additionally, it states that the Foundation has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service.\n   - The section includes a disclaimer of liability for damages, including indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, and limits the liability to a maximum of $1000.\n\n3. **Limitation on Liability (Section 15)**:\n   - This section reiterates the limitations on liability, stating that the Foundation will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, and that liability is limited to $1000.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that Wikimedia tries to avoid taking full responsibility for the safety of its services by disclaiming warranties and limiting liability.

If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.\n\nTo ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our services or these Terms of Use must be filed within the applicable statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).\n\n14. Disclaimers\nHighlighted for emphasis\n\nAt the Wikimedia Foundation, we do our best to provide educational and informational content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your sole risk. We provide these services on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We make no warranty that our services will meet your requirements, be safe, secure, uninterrupted, timely, accurate, or error-free, or that your information will be secure.\n\nWe are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through or from our services creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms of Use.\n\nAny material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any content or communication maintained by the service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time with or without notice.\n\nSome states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full depending on the law.\n\n15. Limitation on Liability\nHighlighted for emphasis\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of the possibility of such damage. In no event shall our liability exceed one thousand U.S. dollars (USD 1000.00) in aggregate. In the case that applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nQuestion: Does Wikimedia purport to disclaim any liability for its services not being safe?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if Wikimedia disclaims any liability for its services not being safe, let's analyze the relevant section of the Terms of Use.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant section**: The relevant section is under \"14. Disclaimers\" which explicitly outlines the warranties and disclaimers provided by the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n2. **Analyze the disclaimers**: The section starts with \"We provide these services on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis, and we expressly disclaim all express or implied warranties of all kinds, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\" This indicates that all warranties are disclaimed.\n\n3. **Specifically check for safety**: The section does not explicitly mention safety. However, the disclaimer of \"fitness for a particular purpose\" could imply that the services are not guaranteed to be safe for any specific purpose. This is because \"fitness for a particular purpose\" generally refers to the suitability of a product or service for a specific use, which could include safety.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the broad nature of the disclaimers and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, it can be reasonably inferred that Wikimedia is disclaiming any liability for its services not being safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}. DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: The fees we charge for using our Services are listed on our Selling fees pages. We may change our seller fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.\n\nIf you are a seller, you are liable for transaction fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of eBay. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer.\n\nYou must have a payment method on file when selling through our Services and pay all fees and applicable taxes associated with our Services by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain collection agencies and legal counsel, suspend or limit Services, and for accounts over 60 days past due, request that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance. In addition, you will be subject to late fees. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax or TransUnion) please contact us at eBay Inc., C/O Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX 78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly.\n\nIn any jurisdiction where eBay has an obligation to collect sales taxes on sales you make using our Services, we may collect such sales taxes from you via the payment method on file under the terms of the Billing Agreement or via any other means available to us.\n\nSeller fees don't purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services. We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers.\n\nQuestion: Is eBay entitled to suspend an account in the event that the credit card registered with such account is rejected?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if eBay is entitled to suspend an account when a registered credit card is rejected, let's analyze the given context step by step.\n\n1. **Payment Method Requirement**: The context states that you must have a payment method on file when selling through eBay's Services. This indicates that having a valid payment method is a requirement for using the service.\n\n2. **Payment Due Date**: It is mentioned that you must pay all fees and applicable taxes by the payment due date. If your payment method fails or your account is past due, eBay can take several actions, including charging other payment methods on file, retaining collection agencies, suspending or limiting Services, and requesting that PayPal deduct the amount owed from your PayPal account balance.\n\n3. **Suspension of Services**: The context explicitly mentions that eBay may suspend or limit Services if your payment method fails or your account is past due.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that eBay has the authority to suspend an account if the credit card registered with the account is rejected, as this would result in a failed payment method and a past-due account, which triggers the actions outlined in the context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if you are obligated to purchase the item after winning an eBay bid, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. **Reading the Full Item Listing**: You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or committing to buy. This implies that you have thoroughly reviewed the terms and conditions of the item.\n\n2. **Committing to Buy**: When you commit to buy an item, your offer is accepted, and this is described as entering into a legally binding contract. This suggests a formal agreement is made.\n\n3. **Bid or Offer Initiating a Non-Binding Transaction for Specific Items**: For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest. However, the question does not specify that the item is a motor vehicle or real estate, so we should focus on the general rule.\n\n4. **Legal Ownership**: The context states that we do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. This is a general statement and does not specify the conditions under which a purchase is made.\n\n5. **Applicability of Law**: Utah Code Annotated 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise. This implies that there are legal frameworks that govern the transfer of ownership, but it does not negate the existence of a binding contract for other types of items.\n\nGiven these points, especially the statement about entering into a legally binding contract when you commit to buy an item and your offer is accepted, it is reasonable to conclude that if you win an eBay bid, you are obligated to purchase the item unless there is a specific clause or agreement that allows you to back out.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

This means that the buyer is entering into a legally binding agreement to purchase the item.\n\n3. **Non-Binding Transactions for Specific Items**: For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction. This means that while the buyer is expressing serious interest, no formal contract is created at this stage.\n\n4. **Legal Ownership Transfer**: The context states that eBay does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. This implies that the transaction is not complete until the buyer agrees to the terms and completes the purchase process.\n\n5. **Applicable Law**: Utah Code Annotated 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code 2-401(2) apply to the transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller agree otherwise. This suggests that there are legal frameworks in place to govern the transfer of ownership.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that for the majority of items on eBay, a winning bid does entail a legal obligation on the part of the bidder to purchase the applicable item, as long as the bidder does not back out of the legally binding contract that was formed when the offer was accepted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

If you sell an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to the User Agreement and applicable policies, including any buyer protection programs, of that other eBay site with respect to that particular sale, as detailed in the International Selling Policy.\n\nYou authorize us to use automated tools to translate your eBay content and member-to-member communications, in whole or in part, into local languages where such translation solutions are available. We may provide you with tools which will enable you to translate content at your request. The accuracy and availability of any translation are not guaranteed.\n\nOne of the ways that we may make eBay.com listings available to international buyers on eBay.com and on eBay's international sites is through the Global Shipping Program. For eligible items located in the United States and purchased by an international buyer through the Global Shipping Program, you (as seller) will simply ship the item to a parcel processing facility located in the United States after receiving notification of payment from the buyer. Pitney Bowes Inc., a third-party global shipping provider, will oversee the processing, customs clearance, and international shipment of the item on behalf of your international buyer. To the extent a buyer has a question about your Global Shipping Program listings, eBay may respond directly to the buyer if the question pertains to the services overseen by Pitney Bowes Inc. (for example, customs or international shipping). Sellers pay no additional fees for selling through the Global Shipping Program.\n\nPursuant to a routed export transaction under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and Foreign Trade Regulations, the buyer, as the Foreign Principal Party in Interest, will agree to assume responsibility for the export shipment, with Pitney Bowes Inc. acting as your buyer's forwarding agent. You remain liable for the accuracy of information you provide about items, and you agree to provide timely responses to requests for additional information.\n\nYou consent to the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information, as well as listing and order information, by eBay to Pitney Bowes Inc., and by Pitney Bowes Inc. to its affiliates, service providers, and other third parties (such as customs and revenue authorities, as well as other government agencies), in connection with the processing, export and customs clearance, and international transportation of any item. eBay does not control the privacy policies of Pitney Bowes Inc., its affiliates, or its service providers, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those parties, as applicable.\n\nAdditional information about the program, including policies governing feedback, the handling of lost, damaged, and undeliverable items, returns, and the resolution of buyer protection claims for items that you sell through the program, can be found on our Global Shipping Program and Global Shipping FAQs pages.\n\nQuestion: Does eBay translate product listings even if I dont ask for that?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n\n2. Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court.\n\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.\n\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\n\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n3. Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\n\n4. Severability\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\n\n5. Opt-Out Procedure\nIF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\").

You should think step by step to solve it.\n\nProvide your final answer in the format \\boxed{YOUR_ANSWER}. DO NOT include any other answer content.\n\nQuestion:\nContext: 1. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\nYOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated.\n\n2. Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court.\n\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. The Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.\n\nIf you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account. Any settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.\n\nThe arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\n3. Costs of Arbitration\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.\n\n4.

If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply to you.

        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if certain users are entitled to refuse the arbitration agreement, let's analyze the provided context step by step:\n\n1. **Opt-Out Procedure**: The context clearly states that there is a procedure for users to opt out of the arbitration agreement.

There is no mention of any other categories of users who can opt out.\n\n3. **Severability**: The context also mentions that the opt-out procedure is the only way to opt out of the arbitration agreement. This implies that no other users can opt out of the agreement through any other means.\n\nGiven the above points, we can conclude that only new users who accept the user agreement for the first time within 30 days and follow the specific opt-out procedure are entitled to refuse the arbitration agreement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.",

These AUP Guidelines create no third-party beneficiary rights. These AUP Guidelines shall inure to the benefit of Instructure and its respective legal representatives, successors, and assigns.\n\nWAIVER, SEVERABILITY & ASSIGNMENT\nInstructures failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. You may not assign any of your rights under these AUP Guidelines, and any such attempt will be void. Instructure may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Service. If any provision of these AUP Guidelines is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of these AUP Guidelines will remain in full force and effect.\n\nMODIFICATIONS\nWe may revise these AUP Guidelines from time to time, and will always post the most current version HERE.

Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. Payment Method means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see \"Cancellation\" below).\n\n1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your Netflix membership by visiting our website and clicking on the \"Account\" link available at the top of the pages of the Netflix website under your profile name.\n\n2. Free Trials\n\n2.1. Your Netflix membership may start with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your membership will be specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new members and certain former members to try the service.\n\n2.2. Free trial eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we may limit eligibility or duration to prevent free trial abuse. We reserve the right to revoke the free trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership are not eligible. We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netflix membership to determine eligibility. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.\n\n2.3. We will charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit our website and click the \"Billing details\" link on the \"Account\" page.\n\nQuestion: Do some Netflix special offers have different terms?\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",
        "Correct Choice": "Yes",
        "Output": "To determine if some Netflix special offers have different terms, let's analyze the provided context step by step.\n\n1. **General Membership Terms**: The context outlines the general terms for a Netflix membership, including the requirement for internet access, a Netflix-ready device, and a valid payment method. It also mentions that unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize Netflix to charge the membership fee for the next billing cycle.\n\n2. **Special Membership Plans**: The context states that Netflix may offer a number of membership plans, including special promotional plans or memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with their own products and services. Importantly, it notes that \"We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\" This implies that the terms for these special plans might differ from the standard membership terms.\n\n3. **Differences in Conditions and Limitations**: The context further clarifies that \"Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.\" This directly indicates that special offers might have different terms compared to the standard membership.\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that some Netflix special offers do indeed have different terms.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}",
