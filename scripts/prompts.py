def get_webpage_to_reasonchain_instruction(prev_reasoning, search_query, document):
    return f"""**Task Instruction:**

You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to analyze web pages and determine if they contain information that helps answer a question, based on the reasoning steps so far.

**Evaluation Guidelines:**

1.  **Direct Answer:** Does any web page directly answer the **Current Search Query**? (e.g., "Yes, Afghanistan grants citizenship by birth" or "No, it does not.")

2.  **Strongly Relevant Clue:** If there is no direct answer, does any web page provide information that **logically implies** an answer or **significantly narrows down the possibilities**? This includes:
    *   Information about the underlying principles (e.g., "The law is based on jus sanguinis/right of blood").
    *   Descriptions of necessary conditions that contradict the query (e.g., "Citizenship requires at least one parent to be a citizen").
    *   Contrasting information (e.g., "Unlike the USA, Afghanistan does not grant citizenship based on birthplace").

3.  **Weakly Relevant Information:** Does any web page provide background context that is related but does not directly help answer the query? (e.g., general history of the law, unrelated clauses).

4.  **No Helpful Information:** The web pages contain no information relevant to the query.

**Output Format:**

Based on your analysis, provide your output in one of the following formats.

- **If the web pages contain a Direct Answer or a Strongly Relevant Clue:**
    - Start with `**Final Information**`.
    - **Summarize the key findings** that directly help continue the reasoning.
    - **Quote the most important sentence(s)** from the web pages that support your summary.

**Example for Strongly Relevant Clue:**
**Final Information**

The web pages indicate that Afghan nationality law is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning citizenship is determined by the parents' nationality, not the place of birth. This strongly suggests that birth in the territory alone is not sufficient.

Supporting Quote: "Afghan nationality is typically obtained under the principal of jus sanguinis, ie by birth to parents with Afghan nationality."

- **If the web pages only contain Weakly Relevant Information or No Helpful Information:**
**Final Information**

No helpful information found.

**Inputs:**
- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  
{prev_reasoning}

- **Current Search Query:**  
{search_query}

- **Searched Web Pages:**  
{document}

Now, perform your evaluation based on the guidelines above.
